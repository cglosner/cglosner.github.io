<h2>Compiler-Based Vulnerability Prevention for Firmware</h2>

<p>We extended <a href="https://github.com/correctcomputation/checkedc-clang">3C</a> &mdash; an automated <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/checkedc">Checked C</a> conversion tool &mdash; to operate within UEFI's freestanding environment. This required redesigning bounds models, annotations, and runtime assumptions so that type-safe code could compile and execute within firmware constraints.</p>

<h3>Key Contributions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Redesigned bounds models and annotations for UEFI's freestanding compilation environment</li>
  <li>Enabled automated memory-safety guarantees for early-boot software</li>
  <li>Demonstrated that strong, automated spatial memory safety is achievable even in firmware</li>
  <li>Published as an Experience Paper at <strong>ISSTA 2025</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>C, Checked C, 3C, LLVM/Clang, EDK-II/UEFI</p>
