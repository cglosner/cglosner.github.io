## Bootloader and Boot-Chain Security (SoK)

A systematization-of-knowledge study surveying bootloader architectures across diverse platforms. This work contextualizes our technical contributions in UEFI fuzzing and memory safety by mapping the broader landscape of boot-chain security.

### Key Contributions
- Identified shared weaknesses and inconsistent trust assumptions across bootloader architectures
- Cataloged opportunities for standardized mitigations at each boot stage
- Offers industry a roadmap for strengthening platform trust from power-on through OS launch

### Technologies
- UEFI, Coreboot, U-Boot, ARM Trusted Firmware, Secure Boot
